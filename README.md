# PickupPointClassification
(This project has been made under the ACMS Programme year 2020)

In long run, we want to crowd source locations for pickup points, where store owners can come and register theur interest. The solution should predict expected QoS (Quality of Service) and their value to our offering (based on multiple parameters like store location, timings, etc)

The focus shall be on building :
- Self-serve portal where in a store can register the interest to be a pickup point.
- Intelligent classification that uses key information to classify expected QoS from the store, and thus provide feedback to the store owners to enhance their QoS.
